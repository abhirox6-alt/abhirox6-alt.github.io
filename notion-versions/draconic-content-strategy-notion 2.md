# 🔥 **DRACONIC CONTENT STRATEGY V2**

---

## Draconic's Worldview: The Foundation

We're not another trading platform adding to the noise. We're building from a place of lived pain - the founder's journey through the emotional hellscape of trading, the isolation, the biases that destroyed good trades, and the realization that humans need augmentation, not replacement.

> **Our Core Belief**: Trading isn't broken. Traders are limited by their biology. We're here to evolve human capability, not automate it away.

---

## Content Philosophy

**We Create Evolution Paths**: Every piece of content should either elevate thinking or reveal who's ready to evolve.

**We Educate Before We Sell**: Value first, product second. Always.

**We Build a Movement**: Not customers, but evolved traders who see markets differently.

**We Maintain Variety**: All narratives stay alive through frequency-based priority, preventing content fatigue.

---

## Content Priority Framework
